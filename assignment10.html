<p>
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a program, make computers very flexible and useful.
</p><br>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3> 
<p>
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The term has been used in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.[2]
</p> 
<h3 id="alu">ALU</h3> 
<p>
An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs.

<h3 id="prgmn langs">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3>
<a href="#go to top">GO TO TOP</a> 
<p>
A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.
</p> 
<h3 id="c">C</h3> 
<p>
C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
</p> 
<h3 id="c++">C++</h3> 
<p>
C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
</p> 
<h3 id="dbms">DBMS</h3> 
<a href="#go to top">GO TO TOP</a> 
<p>
A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.
</p> 
<h3 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h3> 
<p>
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2016, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.
</p> 
<h3 id="odbms">ODBMS</h3> 
<p>
An object database management system (ODBMS, also referred to as object-oriented database management system or OODBMS), is a database management system (DBMS) that supports the modelling and creation of data as objects.
</p>  
<h3 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h3> 
<p>
HDBMS (Hierarchical Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that supports a hierarchical data model. Example HDBMS Systems: Lotus Notes (the most popular HDBMS in use today) IMS - IBM's Information Management System (first HDBMS)</p>
